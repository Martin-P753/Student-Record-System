# Student-Record-System

This little "project" is exactly what the title says it is.

It uses a singly Linked List to store student objects, it will also let them
add and delete students from the list

It will also use a binary tree to search though the students, it will search through using
the students ID.

It is currently not finished and will continue to work on it as time progresses.
